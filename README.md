These are the files for the Help Desk KB Review project. The project itself is a time intensive process requiring the detailed review of approx. 2000 documents that currently are owned by the Help Desk. This website was created to facilitate that process.

The site allows Web Content Writers to automatically fetch the next document to review, allows additions of comments as well as suggested owners.
It also allows users to pick which document they would like to audit if they do not want to audit the current doc that is displayed. Finally, it allows for audit of docs flagged as important as well as well as the rest of the documents. The statistics page is still a WIP.

The front end is largely built with Angular Material and bootstrap just for grids.

The back end is NodeJS, Express and MongoDB in it's entirety.

These are the files for the Help Desk KB Review project. The project itself is a time intensive process requiring the detailed review of approx. 2000 documents that currently are owned by the Help Desk. This website was created to facilitate that process.

The front end is largely built with Angular Material and bootstrap just for grids.

The back end is NodeJS, Express and MongoDB in it's entirety.
